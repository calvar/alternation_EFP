 a) Why is alternation important
 b) A perfect alternation pattern can be obtained with a simple algorithm
 c) Previous attempts to obtain alternation from learning agents
 
2) Implementation of the alternation scheme
   ----------------------------------------
  Once a central agent has generated the alternation pattern, it can be distributed to the set of autonomous agents as a set of rules for each agent. A rule set is composed of two parts, a neighbor list and a set of strategies that indicate which action to take given the observed actions of its neighbors in the previous time step.
